# Deployment Status - September 5, 2025

## What We've Done
1. ✅ Fixed code to allow flexible filenames (horror_pong_game.html accepted)
2. ✅ Removed mandatory requirements for device orientation and control style
3. ✅ Added debug tools to diagnose upload issues
4. ✅ Pushed all changes to GitHub (commit: edec2d0)
5. ⏳ Waiting for Vercel auto-deployment to complete

## Current Status
- **Git Push Time**: ~11:19 UTC
- **Expected Deploy Time**: 1-3 minutes (but taking longer)
- **Site Status**: Accessible but showing old version
- **Debug Page**: Not yet deployed (returns 308 redirect)

## Tools Created
1. **check-deployment.sh** - Run this to check if deployment is complete
2. **test-upload-after-deploy.sh** - Interactive test script for upload
3. **debug-upload.html** - Debug page to diagnose issues (will be at triolldev.com/debug-upload.html)

## Next Steps

### Option A: If Vercel Auto-Deploy Works
```bash
# 1. Keep checking deployment status
./check-deployment.sh

# 2. Once deployed, run test
./test-upload-after-deploy.sh

# 3. Upload your game files:
# - horror_pong_game.html
# - Horror Pong Thumbnail.png
```

### Option B: If Auto-Deploy Not Working
1. Login to https://vercel.com
2. Find your trioll-developer-portal project
3. Click "Redeploy" or check deployment logs
4. Or use Vercel CLI: `vercel --prod`

## What to Look For
When deployment completes, these should work:
- https://www.triolldev.com/debug-upload.html (returns 200)
- Upload form shows "HTML file can be any name (e.g., game.html, index.html)"
- No asterisks (*) on Device Orientation or Control Style fields

## If Upload Still Fails After Deploy
Use the debug page to check:
1. Auth token present
2. API reachable
3. No CORS errors
4. Correct API endpoint

## Contact Support
If deployment doesn't complete in 10 minutes:
- Check Vercel dashboard for errors
- Check GitHub webhook settings
- Manually trigger deploy from Vercel
