### 3. S3 Buckets

#### trioll-prod-games-us-east-1
- **Purpose**: Game file storage
- **Access**: Public read via CloudFront
- **CORS**: Configured for triolldev.com and localhost
- **Structure**: /{gameId}/index.html, /{gameId}/assets/
- **Status**: ✅ Fully operational

#### trioll-prod-uploads-us-east-1  
- **Purpose**: User uploads (profile images)
- **Access**: Controlled via IAM
- **CORS**: Not configured (may need if direct uploads implemented)
- **Structure**: /profile-images/{prefix}/{userId}/{type}/
- **Status**: ✅ Operational

### 4. CloudFront CDN
- **Distribution ID**: E19KSV2LWED5HJ
- **Domain**: dgq2nqysbn2z3.cloudfront.net
- **Origin**: trioll-prod-games-us-east-1 S3 bucket
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed and active
- **Features**: HTTPS enforcement, global caching, compression
- **Performance**: 400+ edge locations worldwide

### 5. DynamoDB Tables
All tables are in US-EAST-1 with on-demand billing:
- trioll-prod-games (game metadata, v0/1.0.0 versioning)
- trioll-prod-users (user profiles)
- trioll-prod-developers (developer accounts) 
- trioll-prod-comments (game comments)
- trioll-prod-likes (like/bookmark tracking)
- trioll-prod-ratings (game ratings)
- trioll-prod-playcounts (play statistics)
- trioll-prod-purchase-intent (purchase tracking)

### 6. IAM Roles & Policies
- **trioll-staging-auth-role**: Production authenticated users (despite "staging" name)
- **trioll-staging-guest-role**: Production guest users
- **Note**: These are the ACTIVE production roles created July 2, 2025
- **Warning**: Do NOT switch to "trioll-prod-auth-role" - it's not in use

### 7. Cognito Authentication
- **User Pool ID**: us-east-1_cLPH2acQd
- **Client ID**: bft50gui77sdq2n4lcio4onql (mobile app)
- **Developer Portal Client**: 5joogquqr4jgukp7mncgp3g23h
- **Features**: Auto-confirmation enabled, developer ID generation
- **Custom Attributes**: developer_id, company_name, user_type

## Recent Issues & Resolutions

### September 10, 2025 - Backend Cleanup
- **Issue**: Fake data Lambda functions serving random numbers
- **Resolution**: Removed fake functions, integrated real DynamoDB data
- **Result**: Real user interaction data now displayed

### January 5-8, 2025 - Developer Authentication
- **Issue**: JWT token developer ID mismatch
- **Resolution**: Fixed token parsing to use custom attributes
- **Result**: Developer games now properly filtered

### API Gateway Route Fixes
- **Before**: Using old/staging Lambda functions
- **After**: All routes point to correct production functions
- **Impact**: Bug fixes now take effect immediately

## Critical Dependencies for triolldev.com

### 1. Authentication Flow
```javascript
// Developer login uses Cognito with custom attributes
POST /developers/login → trioll-prod-users-api
Returns JWT with: custom:developer_id, custom:company_name
```

### 2. Game Upload Flow
```javascript
// Game creation with S3 upload
POST /games → trioll-prod-games-api
Requires: Authorization header with JWT token
Stores: developerId from token, game metadata
```

### 3. Developer Games Filter
```javascript  
// Get developer's games
GET /developers/games → trioll-prod-games-api
Uses: developerId from JWT token
Returns: Filtered game list
```

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### 1. CORS on Uploads Bucket
- **Issue**: trioll-prod-uploads-us-east-1 lacks CORS configuration
- **Impact**: Direct browser uploads would fail
- **Workaround**: Currently using server-side uploads

### 2. IAM Role Naming
- **Issue**: Production roles named "staging"
- **Impact**: Confusion when debugging
- **Workaround**: Document clearly, DO NOT change

### 3. Version Architecture
- **Issue**: Games have v0 (stats) and 1.0.0 (metadata) versions
- **Impact**: Must filter "Untitled Game" entries
- **Status**: Working as designed

## Performance & Monitoring

### CloudWatch Metrics
- Lambda invocation counts normal
- No throttling detected
- Average latency: <200ms
- Error rate: <0.1%

### Cost Optimization
- Removed 3 unused Lambda functions
- DynamoDB on-demand billing appropriate for current scale
- CloudFront caching reducing S3 requests

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
- JWT token validation on all protected endpoints
- Developer ID verification for game ownership
- CORS properly configured on API Gateway
- CloudFront HTTPS enforcement

### Recommendations
1. Enable AWS WAF on CloudFront distribution
2. Implement rate limiting on API Gateway
3. Add S3 bucket versioning for game files
4. Enable CloudTrail for audit logging

## Backup & Recovery
- DynamoDB point-in-time recovery: Not enabled (recommend enabling)
- S3 versioning: Not enabled (recommend for game files)
- Lambda function versions: Maintained automatically

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Infrastructure is stable and operational
2. ⚠️ Consider enabling DynamoDB backups
3. ⚠️ Add CORS to uploads bucket if needed

### Medium-term Improvements
1. Implement CloudWatch dashboards
2. Set up billing alerts
3. Create staging environment
4. Document disaster recovery procedures

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Implement caching layer (ElastiCache)
2. Add API Gateway usage plans
3. Implement blue-green deployments
4. Consider multi-region setup for global users

## Summary
The backend infrastructure is fully operational and recently optimized. All core functionality works correctly:
- ✅ Developer authentication
- ✅ Game uploads with CDN delivery  
- ✅ Real interaction data (likes, plays, ratings)
- ✅ Comments system
- ✅ Analytics tracking

The system successfully serves both triolldev.com and the Trioll Mobile app with shared infrastructure, providing good performance and reliability.
