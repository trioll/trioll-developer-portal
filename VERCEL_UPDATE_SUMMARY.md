# Vercel Website Update Summary

**Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Purpose**: Update "My Games" section to dynamically display all games from S3 bucket via API

## Changes Made

### 1. Added `loadGamesFromAPI()` Function
- Fetches all games from the API endpoint: `https://4ib0hvu1xj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/games`
- Transforms API response to match the expected format
- Updates the `uploadedGames` array with all games from the database
- Automatically calls `displayGames()` to refresh the UI

### 2. Updated Page Initialization
- Changed from `displayGames()` to `loadGamesFromAPI()` on page load
- Now loads all games from the API when the website first opens

### 3. Updated Upload Success Handler
- After successful game upload, now calls `loadGamesFromAPI()`
- Ensures newly uploaded games appear immediately without page refresh
- Removed manual addition to `uploadedGames` array

### 4. Enhanced Navigation
- Added refresh functionality to `showSection()` function
- When navigating to "My Games" section, automatically reloads games from API
- Ensures users always see the latest games

## Technical Details

### API Response Transformation
The function maps API fields to the expected format:
```javascript
{
    id: game.id,
    name: game.title || game.name || 'Untitled Game',
    category: game.category || game.genre || 'Uncategorized',
    thumbnailUrl: game.thumbnailUrl || game.thumbnail,
    gameUrl: game.gameUrl || `https://dk72g9i0333mv.cloudfront.net/${game.id}/index.html`,
    status: game.status || 'active',
    description: game.description || '',
    plays: game.playCount || game.plays || 0,
    likes: game.likeCount || game.likes || 0,
    rating: game.rating || 0
}
```

### CloudFront Integration
- Game URLs now use the correct CloudFront domain: `dk72g9i0333mv.cloudfront.net`
- Automatically constructs game URLs if not provided by API

## Benefits

1. **Dynamic Content**: My Games section now shows all games in the S3 bucket
2. **Real-time Updates**: New uploads appear immediately
3. **No UI Changes**: Maintains existing design and user experience
4. **Automatic Sync**: Always displays current state from backend

## Testing

To test the changes:
1. Visit the website and unlock with PIN (477235)
2. Navigate to "My Games" - should load all games from API
3. Upload a new game - should appear immediately after upload
4. Refresh the page - games should persist from API

```bash
cd "/Users/frederickcaplin/Desktop/Freddie New Web"
