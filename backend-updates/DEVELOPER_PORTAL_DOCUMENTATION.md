## Testing Process

### Step 1: Developer Portal Testing

1. **Access the Portal**
   ```
   Open: /Users/frederickcaplin/Desktop/trioll-developer-portal/index.html
   ```

2. **Test Authentication**
   - Login with: freddiecaplin@hotmail.com / @Freddie1
   - Verify developer ID appears (dev_freddi)
   - Test "Remember Me" checkbox
   - Logout and login again

3. **Upload a Game**
   - Click "Upload Game" tab
   - Verify developer ID is auto-populated
   - Upload a folder with:
     - index.html
     - thumbnail.png (or .jpg)
     - game assets
   - Or upload a ZIP file

4. **Verify Game Upload**
   - Check "All Games" tab - game should appear
   - Check "My Games" tab - only your games shown
   - Click game URL to test (may show 404 until CloudFront deploys)
   - Note the game ID for testing

5. **Test Comments System**
   ```
   Open: /Users/frederickcaplin/Desktop/trioll-developer-portal/backend-updates/test-comments-comprehensive.html
   ```
   - Use your uploaded game's ID
   - Test posting comments
   - Test rating system
   - Test permissions

### Step 2: CloudFront Verification

1. **Check Deployment Status**
   ```bash
   aws cloudfront get-distribution --id E19KSV2LWED5HJ --query 'Distribution.Status' --output text
   ```
   Should show "Deployed" when ready (15-20 minutes)

2. **Test Game Access**
   - Direct S3: `https://trioll-prod-games-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/{gameId}/index.html`
   - CloudFront: `https://dgq2nqysbn2z3.cloudfront.net/{gameId}/index.html`

3. **Verify CDN Performance**
   - Access game from different browsers
   - Check response headers for CloudFront cache hits
   - Verify HTTPS redirect works

### Step 3: API Testing

1. **Games API**
   ```bash
   # Get all games
   curl https://4ib0hvu1xj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/games
   
   # Get specific game
   curl https://4ib0hvu1xj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/games/{gameId}
   ```

2. **Comments API**
   ```bash
   # Get comments for a game
   curl https://4ib0hvu1xj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/games/{gameId}/comments
   ```

3. **Developer Games** (if endpoint exists)
   ```bash
   # Get developer's games
   curl https://4ib0hvu1xj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/developers/{developerId}/games
   ```

### Step 4: Mobile App Integration Testing

1. **Verify Game Shows in App**
   - Open Trioll Mobile app
   - Check if uploaded game appears
   - Test playing the game
   - Verify CloudFront URLs work

2. **Test Comments in App**
   - Navigate to your game
   - Post a comment
   - Verify it appears in developer portal
