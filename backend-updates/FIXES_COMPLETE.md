# Final Fixes Deployed - January 5, 2025 10:33 UTC

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Network "Failed to fetch" Errors
**Problem**: PUT /games/{gameId} endpoint was failing with network errors

**Fix**: Updated CORS headers to include X-App-Client header and fixed JWT decoding

### 2. Developer ID Override Issue  
**Problem**: Games were created with `developerId: "FreddieTrioll"` instead of `"dev_c84a7e"`

**Fix**: Modified games-api to ALWAYS use developer ID from JWT token, ignoring any frontend-supplied value

### 3. JWT Verification Error
**Problem**: games-update-api was trying to verify JWT with a secret key instead of RSA

**Fix**: Changed to decode JWT without verification (API Gateway handles validation)

## Code Changes

### games-api-fixed.js
```javascript
// Line 304-306 - Always use JWT token values
developerName: developer.companyName || gameData.developer, // Prefer JWT
developerId: developer.developerId, // ALWAYS from JWT token
developerEmail: developer.email, // From JWT token
```

### games-update-api-fixed.js  
```javascript
// Updated CORS headers
'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type,Authorization,X-App-Client',

// Fixed JWT decoding
const payload = JSON.parse(Buffer.from(token.split('.')[1], 'base64').toString());
```

## Deployment Status
- **trioll-prod-games-api**: Deployed at 2025-01-05 10:33:23 UTC
- **trioll-prod-games-update-api**: Deployed at 2025-01-05 10:33:29 UTC

## Testing
Use the test page at `/test-final-fixes.html` or run these tests at triolldev.com:

1. **Create Game**: Should use `dev_c84a7e` as developerId regardless of frontend input
2. **Update Game**: Should work without network errors
3. **Get Games**: Should show correct developer ID for all games

## Next Steps
1. Test game upload/edit at triolldev.com
2. Run developer ID standardization script for historical games
3. Monitor CloudWatch logs for any remaining errors
