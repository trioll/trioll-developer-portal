# Triolldev.com API Endpoint Audit
Date: September 10, 2025

## Summary of Changes Made

### Backend Changes (Already Deployed ✅)
1. **Added `/developers/games` handler** in `trioll-prod-games-api` Lambda
   - Filters games by developer ID from JWT token
   - Returns only games belonging to authenticated developer
   - Status: **DEPLOYED**

### Frontend Changes (NOT Deployed ❌)
1. **Updated My Games tab** in `/Users/frederickcaplin/Desktop/trioll-developer-portal/index.html`
   - Line 3317: Changed from `/games` to `/developers/games`
   - Lines 3324-3329: Removed client-side filtering, uses pre-filtered response
   - Status: **LOCAL ONLY - NEEDS DEPLOYMENT**

## All API Endpoints Used by triolldev.com

### ✅ Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /developers/login` - Login
- `POST /developers/register` - Signup
- `GET /developers/profile` - Get developer profile

### ✅ Game Management Endpoints
- `GET /games` - Get all games (used by "All Games" tab)
- `POST /games` - Upload new game
- `GET /games/{gameId}` - Get specific game details
- `PUT /games/{gameId}` - Update game
- `DELETE /games/{gameId}` - Delete game

### ⚠️ Developer-Specific Endpoints
- `GET /developers/games` - Get developer's games
  - **Backend**: ✅ Fixed and deployed
  - **Frontend**: ❌ Changed locally but NOT deployed

## Deployment Steps Needed

### Option 1: GitHub Push
```bash
cd /Users/frederickcaplin/Desktop/trioll-developer-portal
git add index.html
git commit -m "Fix My Games tab to use /developers/games endpoint"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Direct S3 Upload (if configured)
```bash
aws s3 cp index.html s3://triolldev-bucket/index.html
```

### Option 3: Manual Upload
1. Open triolldev.com hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, S3, etc.)
2. Upload the updated index.html file

## Testing After Deployment

1. Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. Login to triolldev.com
3. Click "My Games" tab
4. Should now show your 6 games

## What's Currently Happening

Since the changes are **only local**, the production website is still:
1. Calling `/games` (getting ALL games)
2. Trying to filter client-side by developerId
3. Not finding matches (possibly due to data format issues)
4. Showing "You haven't uploaded any games yet"

## Quick Verification

To verify the backend is working before deployment:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://4ib0hvu1xj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/developers/games
```

This should return your 6 games.
