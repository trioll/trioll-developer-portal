# Vercel Deployment Issue - Confirmed

## Status
✅ **Git push was successful** - Commit edec2d0 is on GitHub
❌ **Vercel is not auto-deploying** from GitHub pushes

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Check Vercel GitHub Integration
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your `trioll-developer-portal` project
3. Go to Settings → Git
4. Check if:
   - GitHub repository is connected (trioll/trioll-developer-portal)
   - Auto-deploy is enabled for `main` branch
   - There are any error messages

### Option 2: Manual Deploy from Vercel Dashboard
1. In your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click "Redeploy" button
3. Select the latest commit (edec2d0)
4. Click "Deploy"

### Option 3: Use Vercel CLI
```bash
# If you have Vercel CLI installed:
cd /Users/frederickcaplin/Desktop/trioll-developer-portal
vercel --prod

# If not installed:
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
```

### Option 4: Check GitHub Webhooks
1. Go to https://github.com/trioll/trioll-developer-portal/settings/hooks
2. Look for Vercel webhook
3. Check if it's active and recent deliveries succeeded

## What's Already Done
- ✅ All code changes committed
- ✅ Successfully pushed to GitHub 
- ✅ Commit edec2d0 contains:
  - Flexible filename support
  - No mandatory orientation/controls
  - Debug tools
  - Updated instructions

## Quick Verification
Once you trigger deployment, the site should update within 1-2 minutes.
You'll know it worked when:
```bash
curl -s https://www.triolldev.com/debug-upload.html -I | grep "200"
# Should return: HTTP/2 200
```
