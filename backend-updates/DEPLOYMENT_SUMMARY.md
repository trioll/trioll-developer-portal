# Developer Token System Fix - Deployment Summary

## Date: January 5, 2025

### Problem
The developer portal at triolldev.com was experiencing authentication failures with "hasDeveloperId: false" errors across all developer endpoints. Game creation and editing functionality was broken.

### Root Cause
1. JWT tokens from Cognito contained custom attributes (`custom:developer_id`, `custom:company_name`, `custom:user_type`)
2. Lambda functions were updated to expect standard attributes, but tokens still had custom attributes
3. DynamoDB table `trioll-prod-games` uses composite key (gameId + version), but Lambda wasn't including version field

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Updated Lambda Functions to Support Both Attribute Types
Modified token parsing to check custom attributes first (currently in use), then fall back to standard attributes:

```javascript
developerId: payload['custom:developer_id'] || payload.preferred_username || null,
companyName: payload['custom:company_name'] || payload.website || null,
userType: payload['custom:user_type'] || payload.profile || 'player'
```

#### 2. Fixed DynamoDB Schema Issues
- Added `version: '1.0.0'` field to all game items (required sort key)
- Renamed game version field to `gameVersion` to avoid conflict with DynamoDB sort key
- Updated both POST /games and PUT /games endpoints

#### 3. Deployed Lambda Functions

##### games-api-fixed.js
- **Function**: trioll-prod-games-api
- **Deployed**: January 5, 2025 10:26:15 UTC
- **Changes**: 
  - Fixed token attribute parsing
  - Added version field for DynamoDB composite key
  - Maintained backward compatibility

##### games-update-api-fixed.js
- **Function**: trioll-prod-games-update-api  
- **Deployed**: January 5, 2025 10:24:44 UTC
- **Changes**:
  - Query for latest game version before updating
  - Include version in update operations
  - Support versioned game schema

### Testing Results
1. ✅ GET /developers/games - Returns 200 with developer's games
2. ✅ POST /games - Creates games with proper schema
3. ✅ PUT /games/{gameId} - Updates games correctly

### Important Notes

1. **Custom Attributes Still in Use**: The Cognito User Pool is still issuing tokens with custom attributes. A future migration to standard attributes is possible but not urgent.

2. **Backward Compatibility**: Both Lambda functions now support tokens with either custom or standard attributes, ensuring smooth operation during any future migration.

3. **DynamoDB Versioning**: The games table supports versioning with version as sort key. All new games get version "1.0.0" by default.

### Next Steps

1. **Monitor**: Check CloudWatch logs for any errors
2. **Test**: Verify game upload and edit functionality at triolldev.com
3. **Future**: Consider migrating to standard Cognito attributes when convenient
4. **Clean Up**: Remove DynamoDB fallback code from Lambda functions (low priority)
