# Debug Report Analysis - Root Cause Analysis

## üî¥ Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Authentication State Mismatch**
```
[15:12:51] No token found
[15:13:25] /developers/profile: SUCCESS (200)
```
**Problem**: No token exists, but profile endpoint returns 200. This is impossible unless:
- The endpoint allows unauthenticated access (security issue)
- Browser is caching the response
- There's a token somewhere we're not checking

### 2. **Missing gameStage Field**
```
[15:13:27] /games: FAILED (400): {"error":"Missing required field: gameStage"}
```
**Problem**: The API now requires `gameStage` field, but our test doesn't include it.

### 3. **S3 Client Initialization Error**
```
[15:13:29] S3 upload error: upload.promise is not a function
```
**Problem**: The S3 client isn't properly initialized. This suggests:
- AWS SDK not loaded correctly
- S3 client created with wrong syntax
- Credentials not properly configured

### 4. **Comments Endpoint Missing**
```
[15:13:27] /comments: NETWORK ERROR: Load failed
```
**Problem**: Comments endpoint either doesn't exist or isn't properly routed in API Gateway.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Why Token Keeps Expiring:

1. **1-Hour Token Lifespan**
   - Cognito default: ID token expires in 1 hour
   - No automatic refresh mechanism
   - Token stored but not validated before use

2. **Token Validation Too Aggressive**
   ```javascript
   if (isTokenExpired(token)) {
       // Clears ALL storage including refresh token!
       localStorage.clear();
   }
   ```
   **Issue**: We're clearing the refresh token too, preventing token refresh!

3. **S3 Client Configuration**
   The S3 upload fails because the client expects old SDK v2 syntax:
   ```javascript
   // Current (wrong)
   const upload = s3.upload(params);
   await upload.promise();
   
   // Should be (SDK v3)
   await s3.send(new PutObjectCommand(params));
   ```

## üö® The Real Problem

The user keeps experiencing this cycle:

1. Login ‚Üí Get 1-hour token
2. Token expires ‚Üí Auto-cleared by validation
3. Appears logged out ‚Üí Must re-login
4. Try to upload ‚Üí Token expired again
5. Even if logged in, S3 client fails

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions Needed

### 1. **Fix Token Refresh Logic**
```javascript
function validateAndGetToken() {
    let token = localStorage.getItem('developerToken');
    let refreshToken = localStorage.getItem('refreshToken');
    
    if (!token) return null;
    
    if (isTokenExpired(token) && refreshToken) {
        // Try to refresh instead of clearing
        return refreshTokenFlow(refreshToken);
    }
    
    return token;
}
```

### 2. **Fix S3 Upload Code**
Need to check which AWS SDK version is loaded and use appropriate syntax.

### 3. **Add gameStage Field**
```javascript
gameStage: 'production' // or 'beta', 'alpha'
```

### 4. **Extend Token Validity**
Update Cognito client to 2-4 hour tokens for better developer experience.

## üìã Immediate Actions

1. **Check AWS SDK Version**
   - Look for SDK script tags
   - Verify S3 client initialization

2. **Fix Token Refresh**
   - Don't clear refresh token on expiry
   - Implement actual refresh flow

3. **Add Missing Fields**
   - Add gameStage to upload form
   - Add gameStage to test requests

4. **Debug Profile Endpoint**
   - Why does it work without auth?
   - Check if it's using cached response
