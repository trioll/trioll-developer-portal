# TRIOLL Developer Portal

## Recent Updates (September 2025 - January 2025)

### üîê Authentication & Developer ID Management (January 5, 2025)

- **Fixed**: Lambda functions updated to support both custom and standard Cognito attributes
- **Fixed**: "My Games" tab now properly displays developer's uploaded games
- **Updated**: 9 historical games in DynamoDB corrected to use proper developer IDs
- **Added**: Multiple debugging tools for token inspection and quick fixes

### üöÄ API Improvements

## Troubleshooting

### Developer ID Missing or Incorrect After Login
If your games aren't showing in "My Games" or developer ID is incorrect:

1. **Quick Fix**: Open `fix-frontend-developer-id.html` in your browser
2. Click **"Fix Developer ID"** button
3. This will sync your developer ID from your JWT token

**Alternative Manual Fix:**
1. Go to the **Debug** tab
2. Check if developer ID matches your JWT token (should be like "dev_xxxxx", not your company name)
3. If mismatched, clear storage and re-login

### Upload Failed: Failed to fetch
Common causes and solutions:

1. **Not logged in**: Make sure you're logged in (check Debug tab)
2. **Missing fields**: Ensure you've filled in all required fields:
   - Game Title (saved as `name` in API)
   - Description
   - Category
3. **File issues**: 
   - HTML file must have .html extension
   - Thumbnail must be an image file
4. **API issues**: Use Debug tab to test API connectivity

### Game Not Appearing in "My Games"
- **Most Common Issue**: Developer ID mismatch (stored company name instead of dev_xxxxx)
- **Fix**: Use `fix-frontend-developer-id.html` to sync correct developer ID
- Ensure your developer ID matches JWT token (check with `check-my-token.html`)
- The game must have your correct developer ID (dev_xxxxx) attached
- Games uploaded before January 2025 may need database correction

### CORS Errors
If you see CORS errors in the browser console:
- This usually means the API Gateway CORS settings need updating
- Contact backend team to verify CORS configuration

## API Endpoints

The portal uses these API endpoints:
- `POST /games` - Upload new game (requires: name, description, category, developerId)
- `GET /games` - List all games
- `GET /developers/profile` - Get current developer profile (requires auth)
- `GET /developers/{developerId}/games` - Get games by developer

## Security Note

- Authentication is handled by AWS Cognito
- Tokens are stored in localStorage (if "Remember me" checked) or sessionStorage
- Developer IDs follow the pattern: `dev_xxxxx` (extracted from JWT token)
- **Important**: Developer ID must come from JWT token, not from user input

## Known Issues & Fixes

### Developer ID Architecture
The system uses JWT tokens as the source of truth for developer IDs:
- **Correct**: Extract developer ID from `payload['custom:developer_id']` in JWT token
- **Incorrect**: Storing company name or user-provided values as developer ID
