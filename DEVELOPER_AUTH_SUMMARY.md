# Developer Authentication - Summary

## What We're Building

Transform triolldev.com from PIN-protected to a full developer portal where:
- Developers sign up with email/password
- Each developer gets a unique ID (like `dev_a3f2k9`)
- Games are automatically tagged with the developer who uploaded them
- Developers can see their uploaded games and future analytics

## How We'll Build It (Using What You Already Have)

### 1. **No New AWS Services Needed** ✅
You already have everything:
- Cognito User Pool for authentication
- DynamoDB tables for storage
- Lambda functions for APIs
- The mobile app's auth system we can reuse

### 2. **Simple Developer ID System**
When a developer signs up:
```
Email: john@gamestudio.com
Password: ********
Company: Awesome Games Studio
↓
Developer ID: dev_a3f2k9 (auto-generated)
```

### 3. **Automatic Game Tagging**
When they upload a game, it's automatically tagged:
```
Game: "Space Runner"
Developer ID: dev_a3f2k9  ← Added automatically
Developer: "Awesome Games Studio"
```

### 4. **Developer Dashboard**
Each developer sees only their games:
```
Welcome, Awesome Games Studio (dev_a3f2k9)

Your Games:
- Space Runner (1,234 plays, 4.5★)
- Puzzle Master (567 plays, 4.2★)
- Racing Pro (2,345 plays, 4.8★)
```

- Future: detailed analytics

### Phase 5: Testing & Launch (Day 5)
- Test full flow: signup → verify → login → upload → dashboard
- Deploy to production
