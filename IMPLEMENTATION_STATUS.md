# Developer Authentication Implementation Status

## Current Progress

### âœ… Phase 0: Infrastructure Setup (READY TO DEPLOY)
- [x] Created Cognito App Client setup script
- [x] Created Developer IAM Role configuration
- [x] Created Cognito Developer Group setup
- [x] Created S3 CORS configuration
- [x] Created DynamoDB GSI setup commands

**Script**: `setup-developer-infrastructure.sh`

### âœ… Phase 1: Backend Updates (READY TO DEPLOY)
- [x] Created `users-api-with-developers.js`
  - Added `/developers/register` endpoint
  - Added `/developers/login` endpoint
  - Added `/developers/profile` endpoints
  - Generates unique developer IDs (`dev_xxxxxx`)
- [x] Created `games-api-with-developers.js`
  - Added developer authentication to POST /games
  - Added `/developers/games` endpoint
  - Auto-populates developerId from JWT token
- [x] Created deployment script for Lambda functions
- [x] Created test script for endpoints

**Scripts**: 
- `deploy-lambda-updates.sh`
- `test-developer-auth.sh`

### ðŸš§ Phase 2: Frontend Updates (NEXT)
- [ ] Update index.html with auth screens
- [ ] Keep PIN protection as first gate
- [ ] Add login/signup forms after PIN
- [ ] Create AuthService class
- [ ] Update upload form with developer info

## Next Steps to Execute

### 1. Run Infrastructure Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/frederickcaplin/Desktop/trioll-developer-portal
./setup-developer-infrastructure.sh
```

This will:
- Create Cognito App Client for developers
- Create IAM role `trioll-developer-portal-role`
- Create developers group in Cognito
- Update S3 CORS for triolldev.com
- Create DynamoDB GSI for developerId

### 2. Manual Step: Update Cognito Identity Pool
After running the setup script, manually:
1. Go to AWS Console > Cognito > Identity Pools
2. Select the Trioll Identity Pool
3. Add the new app client ID to authentication providers
4. Map developers group to the new IAM role

### 3. Deploy Lambda Functions (5 minutes)
```bash
./deploy-lambda-updates.sh
```

This will:
- Deploy updated users-api with developer endpoints
- Deploy updated games-api with developer auth
- Set environment variables

### 4. Test Backend (2 minutes)
```bash
./test-developer-auth.sh
```

This will:
- Test developer registration
- Test CORS headers
- Verify endpoints are working

## Backend Endpoints Now Available

### Developer Authentication
- `POST /developers/register` - Create developer account
- `POST /developers/login` - Developer login
- `GET /developers/profile` - Get developer info
- `PUT /developers/profile` - Update developer info
- `GET /developers/games` - Get developer's games

### Game Management (with auth)
- `POST /games` - Now requires developer auth token

## What's Working

1. **Developer Registration**:
   - Email/password signup
   - Auto-generated developer ID
   - Company name storage
   - Added to developers group

2. **Developer Authentication**:
   - JWT tokens with developer claims
   - Separate from mobile app auth
   - Developer-specific permissions

3. **Game Upload Integration**:
   - Developer ID auto-populated from token
   - Games linked to developer account
   - Developer can query their games

## Ready for Frontend

The backend is fully prepared for the frontend implementation:
- All endpoints are ready
- Authentication flow is complete
- Developer IDs are generated
- Game uploads are tagged with developer info

Next phase is updating the frontend to use these new endpoints!
